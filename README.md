# LaunchPad-Coding-Challenge-1

Description:
--------------------------
The first coding challenge undertaken during my time at Launchpad by Vog.


How to use my endpoints:
--------------------------

Once you have cloned the project onto your computer you should open Postman. It is what I used for the creation/testing of this coding challenge, I used a basic collection and both URI components were unaltered GET requests save for the route to the API itself. The endpoints for feature 1 and 2 can be acessed by Postman through the routes _http://localhost:4200/api/Cups/swap_ and _http://localhost:4200/api/Albums?searchString=insertdesiredsearchStringhere_ respectively. However, second route can end at _/Albums_ without a searchString and will still run. It will simply provide all albums rather than filtering ones for you based on the searchString in that instance.
